# Security policy

At Piiano, we aim for the highest privacy and security standards to keep the data of our users and clients safe. 
If you discover a security or privacy issue, we would love to work with you to fix it.

## Supported versions

The SDKs newest release will be eligible for security updates. 
The tests are provided for educational purposes and to demonstrate integration with Piiano.
We won't backport security updates for old branches. 

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security issue, email `security@piiano.com` with a description of the issue, 
the steps you took that revealed the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue. 
Our vulnerability management team will respond as soon as possible (typically in less than 3 days).
